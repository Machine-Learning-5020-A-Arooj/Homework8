That’s actually pretty decent considering the model barely sees any part of the image. A straightforward way to improve this is to increase the number of pixels we allow the classifier to use. Since we limited it to just 10 columns on purpose, giving it more features (like 20, 50 or even 100 pixels) would let the model see more of the image and usually helps it tell the cameras apart better.\n",

If those pixels happen to be from a part of the scene that’s similar everywhere (like sky or some blank region), the model won’t learn much from them. If we pick pixels from other parts of the image or spread them out more, we’re more likely to capture something unique to each camera.
